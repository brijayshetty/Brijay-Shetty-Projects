# [Project 1 : Heart Disease : Project Overview](https://github.com/brijayshetty/Brijay-Shetty-Projects/blob/main/proj%201%20heart%20.ipynb)

- Built a machine learning model to classify if the given data of a patient should tell if the patient is at the risk of a heart attack. 
- Checked and remove any and all null values, completely cleaned the data.
- Analysed dataset removing information like mean, median, quartiles, etc.
- Built logistic, decision tree and random forest models, compared by making confusion matrix heatmaps for all of them, to determine the best model for the given problem statement. 

# [Project 2: Customer Churn : Project Overview](https://github.com/brijayshetty/Brijay-Shetty-Projects/blob/main/proj%202%20customer%20ch.ipynb)

- Problem statement- to analyze the data of your company and find insights and stop your customers from churning out to other telecom companies.
- Checked and remove any and all null values, completely cleaned the data.
- Used Barplot, Histogram, Scatterplot to compare columns and displayed according to the requirement.
- Built linear and logistic regression, decision tree and random forest models, displayed the confusion matrix and the accuracy score for each algorithm for easy comparision.
