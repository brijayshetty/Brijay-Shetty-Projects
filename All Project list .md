# [Project 1 : Heart Disease : Project Overview](https://github.com/brijayshetty/Brijay-Shetty-Projects/blob/main/proj%201%20heart%20.ipynb)

- Built a machine learning model to classify if the given data of a patient should tell if the patient is at the risk of a heart attack. 
- Checked and remove any and all null values, completely cleaned the data.
- Analysed dataset removing information like mean, median, quartiles, etc.
- Built logistic, decision tree and random forest models, compared by making confusion matrix heatmaps for all of them, to determine the best model for the given problem statement. 

# [Project 2: Customer Churn : Project Overview](https://github.com/brijayshetty/Brijay-Shetty-Projects/blob/main/proj%202%20customer%20ch.ipynb)

- Problem statement- to analyze the data of your company and find insights and stop your customers from churning out to other telecom companies.
- Checked and remove any and all null values, completely cleaned the data.
- Used Barplot, Histogram, Scatterplot to compare columns and displayed according to the requirement.
- Built linear and logistic regression, decision tree and random forest models, displayed the confusion matrix and the accuracy score for each algorithm for easy comparision.

- # [Project 3: Gender detection : Project Overview](https://github.com/brijayshetty/Brijay-Shetty-Projects/blob/main/proj%203%20gender%20detection.ipynb)

- Problem statement- to analyze the image and recognize if the given image is of a male or a female.
- Takes input in form of an image.
- Uses CNN and layers like Relu, MaxPooling, Convolution to name a few, to achieve the result.
- Future uses include Facial recognition, Crowd counting, Medical image analysis, Animal detection and measurement, Anomaly detection, to name a few.
