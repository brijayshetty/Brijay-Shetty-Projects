<ul>
    <li>Built a machine learning model to classify if the given data of a patient should tell if the patient is at the risk of a heart attack. </li>
    <li>Checked and remove any and all null values, completely cleaned the data.</li>
    <li>Analysed dataset removing information like mean, median, quartiles, etc.</li>
    <li>Built logistic, decision tree and random forest models, compared by making confusion matrix heatmaps for all of them, to determine the best model for the given problem statement. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Problem statement- to analyze the data of your company and find insights and stop your customers from churning out to other telecom companies.</li>
    <li>Checked and remove any and all null values, completely cleaned the data.</li>
    <li>Used Barplot, Histogram, Scatterplot to compare columns and displayed according to the requirement.</li>
    <li>Built linear and logistic regression, decision tree and random forest models, displayed the confusion matrix and the accuracy score for each algorithm for easy comparision. </li>
</ul>
