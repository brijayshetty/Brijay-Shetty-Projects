    <ul>
        <li>Built a machine learning model to classify if the given data of a patient should tell if the patient is at the risk of a heart attack.</li>
        <li>Checked and removed any and all null values, completely cleaned the data.</li>
        <li>Analyzed dataset removing information like mean, median, quartiles, etc.</li>
        <li>Built logistic, decision tree, and random forest models, compared by making confusion matrix heatmaps for all of them, to determine the best model for the given problem statement.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Problem statement: to analyze the data of your company and find insights and stop your customers from churning out to other telecom companies.</li>
        <li>Checked and removed any and all null values, completely cleaned the data.</li>
        <li>Used Barplot, Histogram, Scatterplot to compare columns and displayed according to the requirement.</li>
        <li>Built linear and logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest models, displayed the confusion matrix and the accuracy score for each algorithm for easy comparison.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Problem statement: to analyze the image and recognize if the given image is of a male or a female.</li>
        <li>Takes input in form of an image.</li>
        <li>Uses CNN and layers like Relu, MaxPooling, Convolution to name a few, to achieve the result.</li>
        <li>Future uses include Facial recognition, Crowd counting, Medical image analysis, Animal detection and measurement, Anomaly detection, to name a few. </li>
